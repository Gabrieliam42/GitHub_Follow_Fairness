# GitHub Following Followers Fairness

#### This script asks you for your GitHub Username and then for your GitHub personal access token in order to help you with GitHub equity regarding following and followers.

#### If your Github Username and your GitHub personal access token are correct it then proceeds to follow per persons that are following you on GitHub and to unfollow those that are not.
